## ⛩️ A web page for reading manga. 
- The images are ordered with grid layout
- The idea is to make it responsive to cell phones, laptops and tablets. 
- The visual elements were tested in several browsers.
- The next-theme library was used to add two themes, dark and light. It can be switched with a small button on the home page.
- The next js router was used to create dynamic routes.
